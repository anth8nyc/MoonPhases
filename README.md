## Description
MoonPhaser was a collaborative project intent on using moon phase data from an API as well as information from the many aviable NASA APIs to design a web application aimed at piquing interest in the constantly changing information from space. After finding the farmsense API. This refined our User Story to designing a site that allowed a user to view moon phase informtion for any given day they might input- and to record recently searched dates in order to more easily compare similar dates across time, such as a birthday or anniversary. We decided to generate the NASA Astronomy picture of the Day from its respective API upon page load as it was the most astronomy beginner friendly API of the many APIs NASA offers. We will also be having a NASA API incorporated into our page as well.
